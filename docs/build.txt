Building MSP isn't as easy as you might expected. You need to collect following things:

-) PHP source code (www.php.net)
-) PHP development library (www.php.net - windows binaries)
-) Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 SP1
-) Miranda-IM source/headers

Modify mbotvars.bat with your locations of PHP source tree and Miranda source tree and then run it.
